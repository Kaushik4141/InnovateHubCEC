ðŸš€ InnovateHubCEC
InnovateHubCEC is an online platform built for students of CEC to showcase their projects, share their innovations, and connect with peers and seniors working in domains they are interested in.

This platform encourages a culture of building, learning, and collaboration inside our campus. Students can upload their projects, add descriptions, link their GitHub repositories and LinkedIn profiles, and make their work visible to others.

InnovateHubCEC also helps juniors discover and reach out to seniors who are skilled in specific domains, enabling peer mentorship and better knowledge sharing. To keep students motivated and active, the platform includes leaderboards for GitHub contributions and LeetCode problem-solving, inspiring healthy competition and consistent coding practice.

By bringing project showcasing, skill matching, and coding leaderboards together in one place, InnovateHubCEC aims to spark innovation and build a stronger, more connected student community at CEC.
